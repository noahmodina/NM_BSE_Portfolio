# Ball Tracking Robot
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

The ball-tracking robot utilizes two mechanics - a camera and ultrasonic sensors - to evaluate the distance and color of objects through sonar detection and image processing, while sending voltage to its two motors that give it a full range of motion; in total, these functions work through implementing code that sends commands to the Raspberry Pi. 

The current stage of my robot is that while its base/shell is constructed, I wired a Raspberry Pi to a motor driver module through female to male connectors via a breadboard in the middle, which, through code, allows me to control the movement of the robot's wheels. When running the code through VS Code, the robot remains at rest unless acted upon; therefore, I can write certain inputs into the terminal that give me full control of the robot's direction. Separately, I worked on flickering LED lights in order to test the functionality of my Raspberry Pi and deepen my knowledge on its process. 

I've faced harsh technical challenges that required several hours of debugging in order to work around them. For instance, I struggled with establishing a connection between my Raspberry Pi and computer as a result of my computer's inability to connect to a network wirelessly. Therefore, I connected it to an ethernet cable; however, I couldn't find out which network it belonged to. Because the Raspberry Pi requires a wireless connection (rather than a wired one, which would not be sustainable for when I complete the robot), I manually logged into different networks through its desktop mode to test whether it could establish a connection. 

My hope for this project is to expand beyond the blueprint and implement my own modifications to bring the robot to life. 



- An explanation about the different components of your project and how they will all integrate together
- Technical progress you've made so far
- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones
- What your plan is to complete your project

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
